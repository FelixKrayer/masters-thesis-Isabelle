Questions:
  - How to cite / mention Popescus .thy file as basis for proofs? -> cite the Bindings paper (https://github.com/dtraytel/Bindings-as-BNFs/blob/master/thys/Make_Nonrep.thy)
  - is the Failure intended? -> Feature
  - Pattern empty is allowed? Shouldn't be! -> consider it the unit type
  - witness for dpair is impossible? -> doesn't matter, it's not live.
  - list for parallel let, not set? -> make up something. Its written this way...
  - Citation???
