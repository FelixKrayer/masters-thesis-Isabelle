  abstract = {We present a general framework for specifying and reasoning about syntax with bindings. Abstract binder types are modeled using a universe of functors on sets, subject to a number of operations that can be used to construct complex binding patterns and binding-aware datatypes, including non-well-founded and infinitely branching types, in a modular fashion. Despite not committing to any syntactic format, the framework is ``concrete'' enough to provide definitions of the fundamental operators on terms (free variables, alpha-equivalence, and capture-avoiding substitution) and reasoning and definition principles. This work is compatible with classical higher-order logic and has been formalized in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.},

  abstract="We report on a formalization of ordinals and cardinals in Isabelle/HOL. A main challenge we faced is the inability of higher-order logic to represent ordinals canonically, as transitive sets (as done in set theory). We resolved this into a ``decentralized'' representation that identifies ordinals with wellorders, with all concepts and results proved to be invariant under order isomorphism. We also discuss two applications of this general theory in formal developments.",
